# Projectile-Motion-Simulator

This project accuratly simulates projectile motion using the Box2D physics engine. 

The simulator provides users with adjustable:
- Projectile mass
- Initial velocity
- Angle of cannon
- Height of cannon

Once a projectile is in motion the parabolic arc of the projectile will be tracked on screen. 
The user can continue firing projectiles and the arcs will remain on the screen until they are cleared by the user.

# Quiz
The project can be launched in 2 scenarios:

1. Quiz: Users will answer sets of questions and use the simulator to answer the questions.
2. Simulator: Users can use the simulator freely with no quiz questions being prompted to the user.

# Credits
The project is heavily inspired by the University of Boulder Colorado Projectile Motion Simulator: https://phet.colorado.edu/en/simulations/projectile-motion
The simulator is written in C++ using the Box2D physics engine, inside of the QT development studio.
